Under the Project folder

PACKAGES:
Depending on the complexity of the project, there will be mainly AT LEAST three packages:
- pages
- tests
- utilities
In this project, it is enough to use the three packages mentioned above

If you use cucumber tool, there will be more folders like:
- features
- stepdefinitions
- runners

As the project grows, you may need more folders to add, such as
- helper classes
- reports
- controllers
- other modules packages
- resources
- etc
- etc

Bear in your mind that there is no one single rule or way of using POM.
On the other hand, there are very common use of folders

FILES:
It is good to have files under the related packages.
But there are very few files we keep directly under project folder.
Mainly, we will have testNg.xml file if you use TestNG tool
And pom.xml file is also very common to use if your project is a Maven project.
