/*
-	Create a class called Employee with following attributes:
    -- baseSalary
    -- hourlyRate
    -- numberOfEmployees (this field should be increased every time you create a new employee object - you shouldn't have a copy of this field for each object)

-	Create a constructor in Employee class to initialize baseSalary and hourlyRate
    -- baseSalary cannot be less than or equal to zero
    -- hourlyRate cannot be less than zero
    -- If these conditions are not true while initializing baseSalary and hourlyRate throw an exception (IllegalArgumentException).
    -- [I know you haven't learned exceptions yet but throwing an exception is easy thing, you can google it :)](A message from Mr. Halit!!!)

-	Create a method in Employee class called calculateWage with a parameter of which is extraHours.
    And this method should calculate the wage (wage = baseSalary + (hourlyRate * extraHours))

-	Create a method in Employee class (named as getNumberOfEmployees) to return the number of employees (this method should be called using its class name.)
