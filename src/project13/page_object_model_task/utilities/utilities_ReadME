Utilities package is very much like your tool set.

You can create different kinds of classes you need to use throughout the project.
The classes and the method under these classes here are possible to be used commonly, and expensive codes.
This will prevent creating those expensive codes repeatedly.

In this project, you will have Driver class under utilities package.
This Driver class will have at least getDriver and quitDriver methods under it.

What else could we have under utilities:
These could be the following, but not limited to:
- Database class with methods like, accessDatabase, exitDatabase, readFromDatabase, writeToDatabase, etc
- Screenshot class with methods, takeScreenshot, deleteScreenshot, reportScreenshot, etc
- API class, with methods getEndpoint, postEndpoint, deleteEndpoint, putEndpoint
- ManageExelFile class with methods, readFromExelFile, writeToExelFile, exportToExelFile, ImportToExelFile, etc
- etc
- etc
