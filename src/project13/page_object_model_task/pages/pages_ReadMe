Under the pages package

You will mainly have:
- Base class
- your page classes

In your Base class:
- You will initialize your web driver. This is not the place to have creation of your driver. You just initialize the driver here.
- You will initialize WebDriverWait instance
- you will define methods for the GENERIC (common) actions you need, such as "clickOnElement", "sendKeysToElement", "getTextOfElement", etc

In your page classes:
 - This class extends the Base class
 - Use PageFactory
 - List the selectors by using @FindBy or @FindBys annotations, such as "submitButton", "searchBox", "firstNameBox", etc
 - Define the action methods SPECIFIC to your elements, such as "clickOnSubmitButton", getTextOfFirstNameBox", sendKeysToSearchBox", etc
   You will define those element-specific action methods by the help of GENERIC methods in the Base Class
